In order to use Redstone Synthesis you must first specify a directory to the folder
containing all your Minecraft worlds, and also the name of the folder containing
the world you want to use.

Enter the directory for all your saves using forward slashes (/) instead of backslashes, 
otherwise it will cause an error.

Example of directory entry:
C:/Users/user1/AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/saves

To enter the folder name of your world, just enter it as it appears in your files.

Example of world folder entry:
New World
